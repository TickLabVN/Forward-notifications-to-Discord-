# TickPortal v2

## Overview

TickPortal is a centralized notification management system designed to streamline notification handling and recruitment processes at TickLab. This project aims to minimize the time and effort spent by admins on repetitive tasks while enhancing the tracking of notifications and responses from applicants.

## Project Context

Currently, TickLab uses multiple communication channels, including Facebook and Gmail, which can lead to missed notifications or delayed responses. Additionally, admins have to perform various repetitive tasks when a new applicant shows interest in joining TickLab, such as:

- Receiving emails from applicants and forwarding them to Discord.
- Downloading CVs and cover letters, storing them on local computers, and uploading them to Google Drive.
- Updating applicant information on Notion and notifying applicants of receipt of their application, with instructions to await further responses.
- Scheduling interviews, which often requires multiple rescheduling attempts before a time is finalized, and sending final scheduling information via email and Discord reminders before the interview.

This current workflow consumes significant time and reduces work efficiency.

## Project Goals

TickPortal is created to address these issues by:

1. Providing a centralized platform where TickLab members can view all notifications (messages, emails) in one place.
2. Automatically forwarding notifications to the TickLab Notification/Discord channel.
3. Automating admin tasks related to handling job application emails, reducing the need for manual steps.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Notification Hub:** All notifications from multiple communication channels are displayed in a single, accessible web interface.
- **Automated Discord Notifications:** New messages and emails are automatically forwarded to a designated Notification channel on Discord.
- **Admin Task Automation:** Tasks such as forwarding emails, updating records, and sending responses to applicants are automated to save time and enhance workflow efficiency.
